          The Gregory house was built between 1918-1919 due to lack of funds and
          resources then but the greg house as we all call it, holds lots of
          memories from our great grand parent to our generations, I was hoping
          to say generations to come but now that its going out for sale,well i
          can still say generations to come cos afterall this new family would
          love it greg was named after great great great gran (Pa Gregory
          Johnson).
